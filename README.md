# datascience
what a data scientist needs
1. Two-dimensional labeled data structure
2. columns ofj potentially different types
3. manipulate, slice, reshape, groupby, join, merge
4. perform statistics
5. work with time series data

Pandas and the DataFrame

what problem does pandas solve?

Python has long been greate for data munging and prepration, but less so for data analysis and modeling. Pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.

Manipulating pandas DataFrames

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Data Wrangling
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Building Models
5. Visualization
6 Standard and best pratice to use pandas

You'll experience :

1. Importing flat files in a streightforward manner
2. Importing flat files with issues such as comments and missing values

Pickled files (know more about it ..........)

SAS FILES Used for
1. Advanced analytics
2. Multivariate analysis
3. Business intelligence
4. Data management
5. Predictive analytics, standard for computational analysis 

IMPORTING HDF5 file------------

1. Hierarchical Data Format version 5
2. Standard for storing large quantities
3. Datasets can be hundred of gigabytes or terabytes
4. HDF5 can scale to exabytes

MATLAB ---------------- Matrix laboratory-industry standard in engineering and science

SciPy to the rescue
scipy.io.loadmat() - read.mat files
scipy.io.savemat() - write.mat files

Keys = MATLAB variable names
Values = objects assigned to variales
